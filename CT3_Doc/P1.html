        <p class="work-subtitle"><strong>Exploring data chains and server interactions in a playful, experimental way.</strong></p>
        
        <p class="works-paragraph">
            The Web was built around the concept of requests and responses—a constant back and forth between a server on the Internet and a browser on your computer. As it grew and expanded, the need arose to exchange not just between a person and a machine but among many machines.
        </p>

        <p class="works-paragraph">
            A user initiates a single action—a click of a button, a text entry, a page scroll—and the browser triggers a chain of events, most hidden behind the veil of the Cloud, passing data from one server to another like a ball in a pinball machine. The data can request other data, trigger different responses from servers, or be formatted and displayed in different contexts—juxtaposed with other data.
        </p>

        <p class="works-paragraph">
            In the spirit of Rube Goldberg’s fascination with the mechanism over the end result, this project explores how similar systems can be built in the digital realm. What kind of data could be passed around? Which services could be chained to produce unexpected outcomes? What would the triggers and end results look like? The focus is on celebrating the chains of events and the mechanisms that enable them, rather than practicality or efficiency.
